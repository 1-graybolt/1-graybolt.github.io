    <p>Protocol is a set of rules computers uses to make things go well.</p>
    <p>Packets are small data that has been broken down.</p>
    <p>Headers are data that is placed in the beginning of a block of data.</p>
    <p>Payload is the carrying capacity of a packet.</p>
    <p>Router are devices that connects packets.</p>
    <p>Routing tables is a database that keeps tracks of every path/router.</p>
    <p>The problems that can occur on a packet-switched network are that routers in the middle could get overwhelmed and give up. The packets can also go in circles if the routers dont have routing tables even of the router have routing tables it could still take a long time.</P>
    <p>The protocoles that we come up with is to only have a limited bandwith to not overwhelm the middle router and writing the IP address of where it come from and where its going.</P>
